# Methodist North Wound Care Pitch Deck: Complete Intelligence Brief

ActiGraft PRO has a compelling entry point at Methodist North Hospital in Memphis — a system-operated wound care center (not Healogics-managed) serving one of America's highest-diabetes-burden metro areas, inside a health system under severe financial pressure and actively seeking new revenue streams after multiple credit downgrades. The **2026 CMS skin substitute payment collapse** (projected **$19.6 billion reduction**) creates an unprecedented opening for PRP-pathway products like ActiGraft, which bill under a completely separate, untouched NCD 270.3 reimbursement structure. This brief compiles every data point needed to build a decision-ready pitch deck for Sandy Deimund and the Methodist North wound care team.

## Sandy Deimund is a 20-year wound care veteran who built Methodist's limb preservation program

**Sondra "Sandy" Deimund, FNP, CWS** (NPI: 1033622832) is a Family Nurse Practitioner and Certified Wound Specialist with over two decades of wound care experience at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare. She holds an MSN from the University of Memphis and practices under taxonomy 363LF0000X (Nurse Practitioner, Family). Her current title is **Nurse Practitioner for the Limb Preservation Clinic and Comprehensive Wound Healing Center** at Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, based at **3950 New Covington Pike, Suite 350, Memphis, TN 38128** (phone: 901-516-5766).

Deimund's most significant accomplishment is that she **designed and built the Limb Preservation Center from the ground up** — overseeing physical construction, developing the EMR within Cerner, and working with finance and IT to create an entirely new billing process for a service line that was "new to the system." She previously served as **Director of both Methodist South's and Methodist North's Comprehensive Wound Healing Centers**, supervising inpatient WOCNs (Wound, Ostomy, and Continence Nurses) across Methodist North, South, and Olive Branch campuses. She also **initiated a Diabetes Empowerment Education Program** through a Qsource grant serving the community surrounding Methodist North.

Her published thought leadership includes a 2019 Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare blog article, "Outlining the options for patients with chronic wounds and poor circulation," and a featured segment on Local Memphis TV discussing wound healing and limb preservation. In that interview, she stated: *"We have a lot of diabetics in Shelby County, and when I was doing some research, I found that the amputation rate in Shelby County is higher than the national average for a diabetic."* She has received Methodist's **"Power of One" Recognition** and the **Methodist Way Award** for outstanding service. No peer-reviewed publications, major conference presentations, or additional certifications beyond CWS were found in public records, though her clinical operational leadership profile — building programs, managing multidisciplinary teams, navigating hospital system bureaucracy — makes her a high-value clinical champion for product adoption.

## Methodist North operates its own wound care center — it is not Healogics-managed

**Methodist North Hospital** is a **246-bed** community hospital at **3960 New Covington Pike, Memphis, TN 38128**, serving northeast Shelby County communities including Raleigh, Bartlett, Frayser, Millington, and Tipton County since **1978**. It is the only adult hospital in West Tennessee with **Magnet designation** from the American Nurses Credentialing Center. It holds Leapfrog "A" safety grades, Primary Stroke Center certification, and ACC Chest Pain Center accreditation.

The **North Wound Healing Center** (also called the Comprehensive Wound Healing Center) is located in the Physicians Medical Building on the Methodist North campus at Suite 350. Critical finding: **the center is NOT Healogics-managed.** It is a wholly owned and operated service line of Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare. Extensive searching confirmed no Healogics directory listing, no Healogics branding, and no Healogics affiliation. Healogics results appearing for "Methodist" hospitals are for unrelated systems in Texas and Nebraska.

The center offers **two monoplace hyperbaric oxygen chambers**, advanced topicals and antibiotics, and access to a multidisciplinary team spanning infectious disease, vascular surgery, general surgery, cardiology, radiology, endocrinology, orthopedics, podiatry, plastic surgery, physical medicine, dermatology, nutrition, and diabetes education. Typical treatment programs last **12–18 weeks**. The center treats diabetic wounds, burns, trauma, radiation injuries, surgical wounds, pressure injuries, infections, and vascular-related wounds. Patients can self-refer without a referral. Operating hours are Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM – 4:30 PM.

Methodist Le Bonheur operates a second wound care center at **Methodist South Hospital** (1251 Wesley Drive, Suite 107, Memphis, TN 38116; phone: 901-516-3730). No other wound care centers within the MLH system were identified. Specific patient volume and heal rate data for either center are not publicly reported.

## Methodist Le Bonheur is a six-hospital system under financial pressure, now on Premier GPO

Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare (MLH) is a **not-for-profit, integrated system founded in 1918** by The United Methodist Church, headquartered in Memphis. It encompasses **six hospitals totaling approximately 1,700 licensed beds**, over 13,000 employees, and 2,000+ providers. The hospitals are Methodist University Hospital (**583 beds**, flagship/academic), Methodist North (**246 beds**), Methodist South (**156 beds**), Methodist Le Bonheur Germantown (**319 beds**), Methodist Olive Branch (**100 beds**), and Le Bonheur Children's Hospital (**255 beds**). MLH is the principal teaching affiliate of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center.

**GPO affiliation is confirmed: MLH switched from HealthTrust to Premier in March 2023.** The path was Premier (founding LIDN member) → HealthTrust (March 2013) → Premier (March 2023). During the HealthTrust years, MLH achieved $20.4 million in new GPO spend and $1.5 million in contract adoption value in 2021 alone. The return to Premier was driven by supply chain resilience needs. Key supply chain contact is **Rusty Parker, Senior Director of Supply Chain Management**.

MLH faces **significant financial headwinds**. The system posted an **operating loss of $110.3 million on $910.5 million revenue** (–12.1% margin) in the first half of FY2023. Credit ratings have been downgraded multiple times: Moody's from A1 to **Baa1** (three notches), and S&P from AA– to **A+** with negative outlook. Drivers include loss of an exclusive anesthesia group (forcing closure of 5 of 14 ORs at Germantown), a contentious BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee contract dispute in 2023, reduced Medicaid supplemental funding estimates, and transitional disruption from an Epic EHR implementation (go-live October 2024). CEO **Michael Ugwueke, DHA, FACHE** is targeting **$125 million in operational savings**, with a Systems Operational Improvement Team achieving $73 million in year one. MLH also partnered with **Ensemble Health Partners** in July 2025 for full revenue cycle management outsourcing.

The "MLH Reimagined" strategic plan (adopted April 2022) has six pillars: workforce rebuilding, cardiology center of excellence, oncology center of excellence, clinical quality elevation, community health, and technology transformation. **Wound care is not explicitly named as a strategic priority**, but the community health pillar and the system's financial need for new revenue streams create natural alignment for a product that generates meaningful per-patient revenue with minimal capital investment.

## ActiGraft PRO achieves 51% RCT healing versus 18% for standard of care

**ActiGraft PRO** is manufactured by **RedDress Medical** (Israel-based, U.S. subsidiary in Jacksonville, FL). It is FDA 510(k)-cleared (most recently June 2021 for the Ver. 02/RD2 system) and commercially launched as ActiGraft PRO in July 2023. The device creates an **autologous whole blood clot** at the point of care: 18 mL of the patient's peripheral blood is mixed with a proprietary coagulation nanoparticle powder (no centrifuge required), coagulates in approximately 5 minutes, and is applied directly to the wound bed. This is mechanistically distinct from traditional PRP — it contains white cells, red cells, plasma, platelets, fibrin, stem cells, and fibrocyte precursors — but bills under the same G-code pathway.

The pivotal **multicenter RCT** (NCT04185558), published in the *Journal of Wound Care* (2024) and led by **Robert J. Snyder, DPM, MSc, MBA, CWSP** of Barry University, enrolled **119 patients across 16 sites worldwide**. Results showed a **51% healing rate (per-protocol)** with ActiGraft PRO versus **18% with standard of care** — meaning patients were more than **2.7× as likely to heal**. ITT healing was 41% vs. SOC. Notably, **71% of healed wounds in the ActiGraft group remained closed** during follow-up versus 55% in the SOC group. An earlier pilot study (Snyder et al., 2018) reported **72% complete closure at 12 weeks** in a smaller, open-label design — this is the figure RedDress uses in marketing materials.

The comparison landscape for DFU healing at 12 weeks shows ActiGraft's RCT performance is competitive:

| Product | 12-Week Healing Rate | Study Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ActiGraft PRO** | **51% (PP) / 41% (ITT)** | 119 patients, 16 sites | Blinded RCT, 2024 |
| **Apligraf** | 56% | 208 patients, 24 sites | Veves et al., 2001 RCT |
| **EpiFix (large study)** | 70% (ITT) / 81% (PP) | 110 patients, 14 sites | Tettelbach et al., 2019 |
| **Grafix** | 62% | 97 patients | Lavery et al., 2014 RCT |
| **Dermagraft** | 30% | 314 patients | Marston et al., 2003 Phase 3 |
| **Standard of Care alone** | ~24% (meta-analysis) | 622 patients pooled | Margolis et al., 1999 |

The critical differentiator is not raw healing percentage — it is that **ActiGraft's reimbursement pathway is completely untouched by the 2026 CMS skin substitute payment reform**, while every CTP product in the table above faces devastating reimbursement cuts. ActiGraft was added to the **Wound Care Advantage formulary** in October 2024.

---

## The 2026 CMS payment reform annihilates CTP revenue and opens the door for PRP

The scale of the wound care reimbursement crisis cannot be overstated. Medicare Part B spending on skin substitutes exploded from **$252 million in 2019 to over $10 billion in 2024** — a roughly 40× increase — projected to reach **$15.4 billion in 2025**. This represented over 15% of all Part B drug expenditures. HHS OIG identified major fraud, waste, and abuse, including a **$1.2 billion fraud scheme** in Arizona — the largest healthcare fraud in history involving skin substitutes.

CMS responded with sweeping payment reform effective **January 1, 2026**: all 152 skin substitute Q-codes were removed from the ASP+6% payment model and shifted to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule as add-on codes with a **flat rate of approximately $127.28 per square centimeter** — down from some products that previously reimbursed **$1,000–$5,800 per square centimeter**. CMS estimates this will **reduce Medicare skin substitute spending by $19.6 billion in 2026, approximately a 90% reduction**. Coverage is further restricted to a maximum of **8 applications per wound** over a 12–16 week episode, with a mean expectation of 4 applications. Only **18 products** were placed on the "Covered" list, **158 were designated "Not Covered,"** and 154 were left at MAC discretion.

**ActiGraft PRO is completely insulated from this disruption.** It bills under HCPCS code **G0465** (autologous PRP for diabetic chronic wounds) governed by **NCD 270.3** — a National Coverage Determination, which carries higher authority than LCDs. The code covers phlebotomy, preparation, administration, dressings, and all preparatory procedures in a single all-inclusive payment. Current reimbursement rates:

- **Hospital Outpatient (APC 5054): $2,107.97 per treatment**
- **Physician Office/Non-Facility: $1,064.49 per treatment**
- **Coverage: up to 20 weekly applications** for diabetic chronic wounds

Note: While the finalized LCDs were technically withdrawn on December 24, 2025, the **payment policy** (flat $127.28/sq cm) from the CY 2026 Physician Fee Schedule was NOT withdrawn and remains in effect.

## Per-patient ActiGraft revenue can reach $42,000 in hospital outpatient settings

The revenue model for adding ActiGraft to a wound care center formulary is straightforward and compelling, particularly in contrast to the collapsing CTP revenue structure:

**Per-patient ActiGraft economics (hospital outpatient):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Revenue per treatment (HOPD) | $2,107.97 |
| Maximum treatments per patient | 20 (weekly) |
| Maximum per-patient revenue | **$42,159** |
| 12-week treatment course revenue | $25,296 |
| Revenue per treatment (physician office) | $1,064.49 |
| Max per-patient revenue (office) | **$21,290** |

**Volume scenario modeling (hospital outpatient):**

| Patients/Week | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 5 patients | $42,160 | $505,914 |
| 10 patients | $84,319 | $1,011,829 |
| 20 patients | $168,639 | $2,023,658 |

**Comparison to post-reform CTP revenue:** A 5 sq cm DFU treated with a skin substitute under the new $127.28/sq cm rate, with the maximum 8 applications, generates just **$5,091 total per patient**. The same patient treated with ActiGraft over 12 weeks generates **$25,296** in the hospital outpatient setting — roughly **5× the CTP revenue** per patient. Over a full 20-week course, the differential reaches **8× or more**. A Snyder & Ead (2020) cost-effectiveness analysis found ActiGraft's cost advantage over competing skin substitutes ranged from **$2,504 to $6,278 per patient**, with CTPs carrying a **45–114% cost premium** over ActiGraft.

For a system like Methodist Le Bonheur that is actively seeking $125 million in operational improvements, a wound care center adding ActiGraft to treat even 10 diabetic wound patients per week could generate over **$1 million in annual revenue** with minimal capital investment — no tissue banking infrastructure, no HCT/P regulatory requirements, and no product inventory costs since the product is made from the patient's own blood at the point of care.

## Memphis has one of America's highest diabetes burdens, creating outsized DFU demand

The Memphis wound care market is defined by extraordinary chronic disease prevalence. **Shelby County has a 14% diabetes prevalence** — double the national average of 7% — with approximately **110,000 adults living with diabetes** and 60,000 new cases reported over the past decade. One person dies from diabetes every day in Shelby County, and 67% of diabetes deaths occur among Black residents. Adult obesity stands at **40%**, far exceeding the national average of approximately 32%. The county's population of roughly 922,000 is approximately 65% African American, a demographic facing disproportionate chronic disease burden.

Applying national DFU incidence rates (5–10% of the diabetic population developing foot ulcers annually) to Shelby County's 110,000 diabetics yields an estimated **5,500–11,000 DFU patients per year** in the county alone. The broader Memphis MSA (1.34 million) pushes this estimate higher. The payer mix is favorable for Medicare-reimbursed wound care: **164,303 Medicare-eligible persons** in Memphis, with 47.85% enrolled in Medicare Advantage, plus 23.6% Medicaid coverage in the city.

The competitive landscape includes **Baptist Memorial Health Care** (ranked #1 hospital in Memphis by U.S. News 2024–2026, 14 hospitals, wound care through ProHeal Wound Care partnership), **Regional One Health** (the only facility in Tennessee with a 12-patient multiplace hyperbaric chamber, ABA-verified burn center), **Saint Francis Hospital-Memphis** (Tenet-owned, dedicated wound and ostomy center), and the **VA Memphis Healthcare System** (200+ beds, serving 196,000 veterans). Notably, **no Healogics-managed wound care center was confirmed in Memphis proper** — the nearest confirmed Healogics partner is Jackson-Madison County General Hospital, approximately 80 miles away — suggesting a potential market gap.

Methodist Le Bonheur's two wound care centers (North and South) compete in this landscape with Deimund's Limb Preservation Center as a differentiating asset. The Southeast U.S. has the **largest chronic wound volumes nationally** due to elevated diabetes incidence, and Memphis sits at the epicenter of this demand.

## RedDress chose a boutique distributor for exclusive U.S. distribution in August 2025

A critical finding for the pitch narrative: in **August 2025, RedDress signed an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with Legacy Medical Consultants (LMC)**, a boutique wound care specialty distributor based in Fort Worth, Texas, led by CEO Jonathan Knutz. LMC now holds exclusive rights across all U.S. care settings — hospitals, physician offices, VA/DoD, and outpatient wound care centers. This is directly relevant to the Nightingale BioTech distribution proposition, as any distribution arrangement would need to operate within or alongside this LMC exclusivity framework — potentially as a sub-distributor or regional partner.

Regarding **Jacob Smith**: a LinkedIn profile was found for a Jacob Smith at **MiMedx** who was promoted to District Manager in MiMedx's Capital District, with prior experience at **ConvaTec**. He was described by a colleague as someone who "knows how to execute a plan" with "great attention to detail" who "is able to easily distill complex information down into smaller more digestible pieces." If this is the same individual, his MiMedx and ConvaTec background provides deep wound care sales expertise and existing clinical relationships. **No public information was found for Nightingale BioTech** as a registered business entity or wound care distributor — it may be a newly formed or pre-launch entity.

The case for boutique distribution in wound care is well-supported by industry dynamics. Research on Physician Preference Items shows physicians choose medical devices based significantly on **personal experience and relationships with the vendor's sales representative** — often valuing the rep relationship above clinical evidence or cost data alone. Boutique distributors offer several structural advantages over large national sales forces:

- **Clinical depth over breadth**: Focused product portfolios mean reps become true clinical experts rather than carrying dozens of SKUs. Progressive Medical Inc., for example, maintains 80+ clinically trained reps with patient care backgrounds
- **Relationship continuity**: Large companies like MiMedx experienced "higher than normal employee and customer attrition" in 2024 as competitors poached reps. Boutique firms with mission-oriented cultures offer more stability
- **Agility in hospital value analysis**: The shift from individual physician purchasing to committee-based Value Analysis Committee (VAC) decisions requires navigating clinicians, administrators, finance, and supply chain simultaneously — a process where dedicated, knowledgeable reps outperform volume-focused sales organizations
- **Cost efficiency for manufacturers**: MiMedx spends approximately $240 million annually on SG&A. Boutique distributors provide market access at a fraction of this investment

## Conclusion: the convergence of regulatory disruption, clinical need, and system economics

Three forces converge to make this pitch opportunity unusually well-timed. First, the **2026 CMS skin substitute payment collapse** eliminates the revenue foundation that most wound care centers have relied upon for advanced therapies, creating urgent demand for alternative reimbursement pathways — and ActiGraft's G0465 pathway is the most compelling substitute, generating 5–8× the per-patient revenue of reformed CTP payments. Second, **Methodist Le Bonheur's financial pressure** (multiple credit downgrades, $110 million operating losses, active pursuit of $125 million in savings) makes revenue-generating clinical innovations with minimal capital requirements exceptionally attractive to system leadership. Third, **Memphis's extraordinary diabetes burden** (14% prevalence, 110,000 diabetics, estimated 5,500–11,000 DFU patients annually) provides a patient population that could sustain $1 million+ in annual ActiGraft revenue at a single wound care center.

Sandy Deimund is the ideal clinical champion — she built the Limb Preservation Center from scratch, navigated EMR development and new billing processes, and has publicly advocated for addressing Shelby County's above-average amputation rates. The fact that Methodist North's wound care center is **self-operated rather than Healogics-managed** means formulary decisions are made internally by MLH leadership, potentially simplifying the adoption pathway compared to Healogics-gated centers. The pitch should address the LMC exclusive distribution relationship transparently, positioning Nightingale BioTech's role within that framework, and leveraging Jacob Smith's wound care sales background (MiMedx, ConvaTec) as evidence of deep market understanding and clinical credibility.
